# 📊 Student Performance Data – Excel Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Microsoft Excel can be used for **data analysis and decision-making** in a student performance dataset.

I created a dataset of **20 students**, each with scores in:

* **English**
* **Math**
* **Physics**
* **Chemistry**

Using Excel formulas (`IF`, `AND`, `OR`), I automated classification into outcomes:
✅ **Admitted** or ❌ **Try Again**

## 🎯 Key Features

* Dataset of **20 student records**.
* Subjects: English, Math, Physics, Chemistry.
* Evaluation formula:

```excel
=IF(AND(G2="Pass",H2="Pass",OR(I2="Pass",J2="Pass")),"Admitted","Try again")
```

* Automated results with clear admission criteria.
* Clean table layout for readability.
